# CoronaVirus_data
I scraped the data from the website with BeautifulSoup.
I got the country names, population, active cases and total cases tested.

# percentage active cases
I divide the active cases by the population times 100 to get the percentage of the population that is infected in the country.

# percentage totalCases
Then i divide total cases tested ever by the population times 100 to get the percentage of the population that was ever
infected in that country
